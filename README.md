**[View Live Website](https://boneyphilip.github.io/duplicate-co2clock/)**

## About

CO‚ÇÇ Clock is a comprehensive web application designed to raise awareness about atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and their impact on climate change. The platform provides simulated real-time CO‚ÇÇ tracking, interactive visualizations of global emissions data, and educational content about climate science and solutions.

This project aims to make climate data accessible and understandable for everyone, from students and educators to policymakers and environmental advocates. By presenting complex climate information in an engaging, visual format, CO‚ÇÇ Clock encourages users to understand the urgency of climate action and explore practical solutions for reducing carbon emissions.

The website features a complete user journey including a homepage with CO‚ÇÇ simulation, comprehensive emissions dashboard, educational articles, project information, contact functionality, and a user-friendly thank you page for form submissions. The site targets environmentally conscious individuals, educators, students, and anyone interested in understanding the current state of our atmosphere and the steps we can take to address climate change.

## Data Methodology

### CO‚ÇÇ Simulation
- **Starting baseline**: Approximately 428 ppm based on recent atmospheric measurements
- **Increment calculation**: Small increases applied every few seconds to simulate ongoing emissions
- **Educational purpose**: Numbers represent realistic current atmospheric levels for learning

### Emissions Data
- **Static dataset**: 70 countries with emissions data stored in JavaScript arrays
- **Data structure**: Each country includes rank, total emissions, per capita, percentage of global total
- **Source basis**: Compiled from publicly available climate research and statistical sources
- **Update method**: Manual updates to JavaScript files when new data becomes available

### Charts and Visualizations
- **Chart.js library**: Powers all interactive charts and graphs
- **Data processing**: JavaScript functions sort, filter, and display information dynamically
- **Real-time feel**: Updates happen instantly since data is locally stored

*Note: This is an educational project using simulated and compiled data, not live API feeds*
